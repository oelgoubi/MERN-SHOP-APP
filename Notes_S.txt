-------------- What I will Do ----------
Let's learn how to develop MERN STACK apps 
with Deployment on huroko mLab to make the application mLaband Authentification using JWT to protect 
backend routes
 and using package react-bootstrap 
also react-transition-group for annimation

----------------------------------------
$npm install express body-parser mongoose concurrently --save

concurrently package : so we can more than one npm script at a time 
so we can run the server and the client at the same time 

$ npm i -D nodemon  : install nodemon and save it as  Dev  dependency 
because it's not needed for production 
---- so there is two phases : Development and production

add this :

"scripts": {
    "start": "node server.js", // to run in production : we have to re run the server every serverside change
    "server":"nodemon node.js"  // but this will watch it 
  }

  //// Then we run the script names server once 
  $ npm run server
